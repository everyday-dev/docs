# Introduction 👋
Welcome to great lakes dev! A collection of projects and products all containing FOSS and OSHW. The goal is to provide cool and useful tools, gadgets and software designs to you for free so you can build it on your own!

🛒 If you just want to start tinkering with a piece of hardware and skip the build, you can pickup a fully built piece at the [shop - COMING SOON](./intro).

🗒️ To stay up to date on great lakes dev as well as view walk-throughs, teardowns and product spotlights check out the [blog](/blog/introduction).

📚 If you're looking for documentation - you came to the right place. You can browse every project currently posted publicly and view hardware diagrams, useage instructions and examples. New suggestions and contributions are always welcome, just head over to the [Github repository](https://github.com/greatlakesdev/docs/issues) for the docs and create a new issue explaining what you think should be added.
