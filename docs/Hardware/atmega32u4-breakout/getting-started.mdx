# Getting Started
To get started using the atmega32u4 breakout board I highly recommend you use our [avr-cmake-template](https://github.com/greatlakesdev/avr-cmake-template). You can find
the docs that walk through the template and explain how to customize it [here](https://www.greatlakesdev.io/docs/Firmware/avr-cmake-template/), but its default
configuration is setup for the atmega32u4 so no changes are necessary. It does assumes you will be using a programmer like the avrispMKII or the Atmel-ICE programmer to
program the chip via the on-board ```PROG```/```ISP``` header.
