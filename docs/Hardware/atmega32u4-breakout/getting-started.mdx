# Getting Started
The default setup for the atmega32u4 breakout board is ready to use in ```bare-metal``` applications and uses either the USB-DFU bootloader or an ISP programmer like the
AtmelICE or avrispMKII programmers.
:::note
It is an option to purchase the atmega32u4 breakout board pre-loaded with the Arduino Micro bootloader so you can get up and running right away in the
Arduino IDE!
:::

In ```bare-metal``` applications we highly recommend you use our [avr-cmake-template](https://github.com/greatlakesdev/avr-cmake-template) as
it handles a lot of the project setup and tooling for you. You can find the docs that walk through the template and explain how to customize it [here](/docs/avr-cmake-template/).
However, the default configuration is setup for the atmega32u4 so no changes are necessary to get started.
