## Introduction
If you have an atmega32u4 breakout board with the ```bare-metal``` bootloaders (or empty flash) and would like to use the board with the Arduino IDE, we will need to do
a couple different things. To begin you will need to gather the necessary tools outlined in the Prerequisite section

## Prerequisites
You will need a couple different tools to write the Arduino bootloader
- [avrdude](https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- AVR ISP programmer (1x of the following)
    - [AVRISP MKII programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Programmer-USB-AVRISP-XPII-Compatible/dp/B00KM6ZA9I/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2E8DSYQHJD8S8&keywords=avrisp+mkii&qid=1672774084&s=electronics&sprefix=avrisp+mkii%2Celectronics%2C78&sr=1-4)
    - [Atmel ICE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ATATMEL-ICE)
    - Arduino running the ```Arduino ISP``` example sketch

:::warning
If you use an Arduino as an ISP programmer, make sure it is an Arduino with 3.3V logic levels. An Arduino Uno, for example, will not work as it runs a 5V logic level and can cause
damage to the atmega32u4 pins.

## Writing the fuses
At the time of writing this documentation, I was having issues getting the Arduino IDE to properly write the AVR fuses for me. To get around this I had to use ```avrdude```
and an ISP programmer to first write the fuses myself before writing the bootloader with the Arduino IDE. The fuse values are as follows:
- LFUSE: 0xDE
- HFUSE: 0xD8
- EFUSE: 0xCB

The most notable change in these fuse values are to enable the boot reset vector fuse which causes the MCU to start looking for a bootloader in the boot section of flash where the Arduino
bootloader will be placed. The other changes consist of setting the clock to use the EXT crystal (16MHz) and disable the ```DIV/8``` fuse giving a
final core clock of 16MHz.

To write the fuses you need to connect the 6pin ISP header to your programmer and then execute the following via CLI (The below uses the Atmel ICE programmer)
```console
avrdude -p atmega32u4 -c atmelice_isp -U lfuse:w:0xde:m -U hfuse:w:0xd8:m -U efuse:w:0xcb:m
```

With the fuses set, we are now ready to open the Arduino IDE and flash the bootloader.

## Flashing the Arduino bootloader
To write the bootloader we need to open the Arduino IDE set the correct board. We want to select the ```Arduino Micro``` as this is another Arduino based board using the same
atmega32u4 MCU:
```Tools -> Board -> Arduino AVR Boards -> Arduino Micro```. Now set the programmer to the correct ISP programmer you are using: ```Tools -> Programmer -> Atmel-ICE (AVR)```.

With our board and programmer set, we are ready to write the bootloader: ```Tools -> Burn Bootloader```. This process will take 1 to 2 minutes to complete. Once finished, power-cycle
the board and you should now see the ```Arduino Micro``` show up as an available Port under ```Tools -> Port```

:::note
You might encounter an error at the end of writing the bootloader such as the following:
```console
avrdude: verification error, first mismatch at byte 0x0000
         0xff != 0x2f
avrdude: verification error; content mismatch
Failed to burn bootloader: uploading error: exit status 1
```
This can be ignored and you should now have the ```Arduino Micro``` available under ```Tools -> Port```
