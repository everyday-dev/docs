After a prolonged hiatus, we're excited to be back writing blog posts again! A lot has changed since our last post, including
name! We've rebranded from greatlakes dev to everyday⚡dev! We believe this new name aligns with how we feel: engineering isn't just a job -
it's our passion. We thrive on the joy of creating innovative solutions day in and day out. We know a lot of folks can sympathize with this feeling and we hope to build a community around this.

So what's next?

Our mission is to share knowledge and help others grow in their personal and professional
embedded journeys. In pursuit of our mission, we plan to post content on a more regular basis, including deep dives for embedded concepts and creating more open source hardware and firmware projects.
