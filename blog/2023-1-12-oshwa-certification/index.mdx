During the holdiays we submitted the [breadboard-io](/docs/breadboard-io) and [atmega32u4 breakout](/docs/atmega32u4_breakout/introduction) boards for
certification and we've just heard back - we've been certified! This will definitely be the first of many as we continue to create more projects
and share them with everyone.
