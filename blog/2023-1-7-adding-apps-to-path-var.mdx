title: DEV101 âš¡ Adding applications to the PATH env variable

It often occurs in a developers day that they need to install a new application and be able to access it from the command line. In most cases a nicely packaged
installer (```.msi```, ```.exe``` or ```.AppImage```) is there to handle this process for you, along with setting up directories and default config all with a few clicks through a GUI.
Same goes for installing packages via a package manger like ```apt``` for Linux or ```choco``` for Windows. A single command and the process is done.

Although this is incredibly convenient, not all applications ship with an installer. You may encounter application directories that have been "zipped" or "tar-balled", and once
extracted gives you access to the application and dependencies when executed from it's current home. When you receive a compressed application folder like this, it might just be
the needed application or there will often be a folder within called ```bin``` which contains all of the necessary exectuables - including the binary you likely want to execute from the command line. The easiest
way to make these binaries accessible is to add the included ```bin``` directory to your ```PATH``` environment variable. The few steps below will walk you through doing this in both Linux and Windows.

:::note
As an example, we are going to install the [dfu-programmer](https://github.com/dfu-programmer/dfu-programmer/releases/tag/v1.0.0) CLI which allows a user to reflash
Atmel AVR microcontrollers via the USB-DFU class. The contents or use of the application is not important here but rather the process. If you'd like to follow along installing
a different application, feel free to do so.

- To begin, place the uncompressed application folder wherever you'd like on the filesystem. Typically when installing applications in this manner,
you would place the application in the ```/usr/local``` folder.
```console
sudo mv dfu-programmer/ /usr/local/dfu-programmer
```
- Now that the application is in its final resting place, we can begin to add it to our PATH variable. If we ```ls``` the application directory, we find the ```dfu-progammer```
executable. You may have another layer with a ```bin``` folder within that then contains your executable you want to execute. Regardless of where the binary actually lives, we
want to add the full path to its location to our PATH environment variable. To do so, edit the ```.bashrc``` file located in your home directory.
```bash
vi ~/.bashrc
````
- Add the following line anywhere in the ```.bashrc``` file. This rc file is loaded every time a terminal is opened. The line below will prepend the location of our executable
to the ```PATH``` environment variable. Note that this is the folder that contains the executable and we do not include the executable name when adding it to our environment
variable. This list of directories in the ```PATH``` environment variable are searched through when trying to find a matching application to a command
called on the CLI.
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/dfu-programmer:$PATH
```
- To test if our changes worked, source the rc file - making our current shell aware of the new directory we've added to the ```PATH``` environment variable.
```console
source ~/.bashrc
````
- Now try and execute our application from any directory on the file system.
```console
cd ~
dfu-programmer --version
```
- You should get a version string of 1.0.0
```console
dfu-programmer 1.0.0
````

That's it! You now have access to your application via the command line. This process can be repeated as necessary for multiple applications. The line added to the ```.bashrc```
file prepends and builds a larger and larger list and does not replace any previous lines.
