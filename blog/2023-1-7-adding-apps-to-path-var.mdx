It often occurs in a developers day that they need to install a new application and be able to access it from the command line. In most cases a nicely packaged
installer (```.msi```, ```.exe``` or ```.AppImage```) is there to handle this process for you along with setting up directories and default config, all with a few clicks through a GUI.
Same goes for installing packages via a package manger like ```apt``` for Ubuntu or ```choco``` for Windows. A single command and the process is done.

Although this is incredibly convenient, not all applications ship with an installer. You may encounter application directories that have been "zipped" or "tar-balled" and once
extracted gives you access to the application and dependencies when executed from it's current home. When you receive a compressed application folder like this it might just be
the needed application inside or there may be a folder within called ```bin``` which contains your application. The easiest way to make the application accessible from the CLI is to add
the folder path containing it to the ```PATH``` environment variable. The few steps below will walk you through doing this in both Linux and Windows.

:::note
As an example, we are going to install the [dfu-programmer](https://github.com/dfu-programmer/dfu-programmer/releases/tag/v1.0.0) CLI which allows a user to reflash
Atmel AVR microcontrollers via the USB-DFU class. The contents or use of the application is not important here but rather the process. If you'd like to follow along installing
a different application, feel free to do so.

To begin, place the uncompressed application folder wherever you'd like on the filesystem. Typically when installing applications in this manner,
you would place the application in the ```/usr/local``` folder.
```console
sudo mv dfu-programmer/ /usr/local/dfu-programmer
```

If we ```ls``` the application directory, we find the ```dfu-progammer``` executable. You may have another layer with a ```bin``` folder within that then contains your executable you want to
execute. Regardless of where the binary actually lives, we want to add the full path to its location to our PATH environment variable. To do so, edit the ```.bashrc``` file located in your home directory.
```bash
vi ~/.bashrc
````

With the ```.bashrc``` file open - Add the following line anywhere in the file.
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/dfu-programmer:$PATH
```
This rc file is loaded every time a terminal is opened and the line we just added will prepend the location of our executable to the ```PATH``` environment variable. To re-iterate, this line adds to
the enviroment variable and does not overwrite it. This means if we have multiple applications to install in this manner, we can have multiple export statements that don't overwrite one another. By adding
these export statements, we build a list of directories that are searched any time a binary is called from the command line.
:::caution
When adding the export statements you should use the path to the folder that contains the executable and should not include the executable name.
:::

To test if our changes worked, source the rc file - making our current shell aware of the new directory we've added to the ```PATH``` environment variable.
```console
source ~/.bashrc
````

Now try and execute our application from any directory on the file system.
```console
cd ~
dfu-programmer --version
```

If we were succesfull then we should see a version string of 1.0.0 printed on the console.
```console
dfu-programmer 1.0.0
````
:::note
If the above did not work and you see something like ```Command X not found, did you mean:```, verify that the full path to the folder containing your executable was properly added to the
```.bashrc``` file. To guarantee the new rc file is being sourced you can close your terminal, open a new one and try the command again.
:::

That's it! You now have access to your application via the command line. This process can be repeated as necessary for multiple applications. The line added to the ```.bashrc```
file prepends and builds a larger and larger list and does not replace any previous lines.
