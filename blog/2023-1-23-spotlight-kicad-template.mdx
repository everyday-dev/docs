The [KiCAD project template](https://github.com/greatlakesdev/kicad-project-template) just got even easier to use! The [docs](/docs/kicad-project-template) have had a new addition made
for the template explaining how to configure and get designing quickly and also documents several of the new features. To summarize - the template is pre-configured with
the smallest possible tolerances while staying in the PCBWay standard stackup, allowing the most versatility while designing without costing too much money. A ```util/``` folder has
been added with a few python scripts making it easier to generate useful BOMs from a somewhat finicky system that KiCAD currently uses. Lastly a Github workflow has been added to
automate the release process and guarantees consistent look, structure and content between your releases.

- 📚 [Documentation](/docs/kicad-project-template)
- 🏗️ [Template](https://github.com/greatlakesdev/kicad-project-template)

These features and workflows have been tested and documented but please reach out and create an issue if you have any trouble.

Happy tinkering!
