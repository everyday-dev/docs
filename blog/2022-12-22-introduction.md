Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Stephen and I'm the creator and maintainer of everydayâš¡dev - A collection of projects and products all containing FOSS and OSHW. The goal is to provide cool and useful tools, gadgets and software to you for free to build on your own.<!--truncate--> We also want to provide pre-built hardware for sale at a low cost on an online store, that way you can skip the build and get straight to tinkering if you'd like. This site at the time of writing exists to hold the blog posts I write and the [documentation](/docs) for great lakes dev projects and products and you can expect a couple different things from this blog:
- General everydayâš¡dev updates
- Showcases of projects/products
- Walk-through/guides on various Embedded Engineering problems/subjects
- Multi-part build updates and potential tear-downs/exploration of existing products

If you'd like to reach out to suggest topics, projects or just to chat, considering connecting with me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@stephendpmurphy)!
