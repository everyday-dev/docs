# everyday dev | electronic product design
At everyday dev, engineering isn't just a job - it's our passion. We thrive on the joy of creating innovative solutions day in and day out. Aside from creating products for others we also share our open-source work so others can learn and build it themselves. Check out our projects below and let us know if we can help you out in any way.

# We've moved. 
In an effort to truly own and be in full control of our clients and personal information, source code, and documentation we've moved to a self-hosted Git server. You can find this project here: [git.everydaydev.io](https://git.everydaydev.io/opensource/opensource)
